# OA_Coupling_efficiency
In free-space optical communication, the propagation of a laser beam through the atmosphere causes wavefront distortions that decrease the coupling efficiency (CE) from free space to single-mode fiber. With this MATLAB rutine based on OOMAO toolbox, we verify coupling efficiency using Adaptive Optics
